# Overview
This repository is a side-by-side repository to go along with my development tutorial series on YouTube. As videos go up, I will link them here (in the event you're here viewiing my portfolio and are curious).

## Use
Each unit will have a folder. For example, `1-Programming-Basics` is all the code relevant to the first unit, covering the basics of programming. There should be 5 total folders and this file in the repository. 
If you are looking for a quick glance at a solution, feel free to just poke around! You can go through this just like a normal file explorer, click around and see some files. However, if you have Git installed on your machine (which I cover in module 4) then you can *clone* this repository and see all the code, and run it for yourself. Alternatively, you can **download a zip folder version of this repo for a more up-close look**.
