# Overview
This project will be much looser than all the previous ones. Where the previous ones were
designed to test your knowledge of, and give you practice with, a specific concept, this is to 
tie it all together and give you a chance to practice *everything*.

## Task:
Make a mock airline flight manager. This will consist of two classes:

## Flight.java
Make a class that represents a flight. Give it a maximum capacity, as well as a 
departing airport code, and an arrival airport code. Give it an estimated duration, as well as a price per ticket.
Implement the toString method to give an appropriate printed response, as well as make sure to include an appropriate constructor. Include a way to keep 
track of how many passengers have booked a flight. Include getters and setters
for all properties. Write a method called allows the flight to get "booked," increasing the total number of passengers by 1. Add a way to cancel the flight as well.

## Program.java
Implement two flights and print them out. Intialise them with relevant data, it doesn't matter.
